# NBA Team Rating Scatter Plot Gif Script

NBA Team Rating data can be exported daily through https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_ratings.html

The script requires imageio to generate gif plots. Most IDE doesnâ€™t include it as part of the default libraries. Please use pip install imageio or Anaconda user conda install imageio on your command prompt.

To run the scatter plot gif script: place the team_logo folder, team_rating_data.xlsx, and NBA_team_rating_scatterplots.py in the same folder. 

Run the python script to generate a team rating scatter plot gif.
